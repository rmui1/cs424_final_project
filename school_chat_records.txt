Example: I'm hungry. I have the following items: shirt. Which item is best for me? Pick one of the items and 
                    answer with one word, all lowercase, and no punctuation. If none of the items are good, pick a 
                    random one, but tell me that its usefulness is 0. Then, rate the object in terms of its usefulness
                    to me at the moment, from 1 to 10. Explain in second-person point of view. Phrase your response 
                    in the form: item;number;explanation


                    shirt;0;You can't eat a shirt, but it's the only available item.

                        in terms of its usefulness to me at the moment, from 1 to 10. Explain in second-person 
                        point of view. Phrase your response in the form: item;number;explanation
